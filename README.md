## 🧠 Operations Explained

### Logical AND (&&)
Returns `1` only if both inputs are `1`.

### Logical OR (||)
Returns `1` if at least one input is `1`.

### Logical NOT (!)
Flips the binary value:
- `0` → `1`
- `1` → `0`

### Bitwise AND (&)
Performs AND operation bit by bit.

### Bitwise OR (|)
Performs OR operation bit by bit.

### Bitwise XOR (^)
Returns `1` if bits are different.

### Bitwise NOT (~)
Inverts all bits.

### Left Shift (<<)
Shifts bits to the left.

### Right Shift (>>)
Shifts bits to the right.

### Unsigned Right Shift (>>>)
Shifts bits right and fills left side with zeros.
